 Stu -- Build Automation
=========================

This is Stu, a build tool in the spirit of Make, but with three features
that set it apart:  

* Parametrized rules:  Like GNU Make's '%' character, but there can be
  multiple parameters, and they have names.  The syntax is '$NAME',
  where NAME can be any string.  Parameters are injected transparently
  into the commands. 
* Dynamic dependencies:  The dependencies of a target can be generated
  dynamically.  When a dependency is enclosed in square brackets, it means
  that that file is built and dependencies are read from within that
  file. 
* Parentheses and brackets support concatenation, allowing parametrized
  filenames to be generated in the first place. 

In many scenarios, these three features interact judiciously to give
very concise and easy to understand constructs that are nearly
impossible to realize with Make.

 Installation Guide
--------------------

* See the file INSTALL for compiling Stu yourself
* Package for Arch Linux:  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stu-git/

Stu is written in C++11 for POSIX platforms.  You should have no problem
getting it to run on vanilla Linux and other POSIX-compliant platforms.  

-----------------------
 Design Considerations
-----------------------

The design considerations of Stu are:

* Genericity:  In many projects, the same rule has to be executed over
  and over again with varying parameters.  This is particularly true in
  data mining / data science / machine learning and related areas, but
  also applies to simply compiling programs with varying compiler
  options, etc.  Being able to do this using a clean syntax and friendly
  semantics is the main motivation of Stu, and where virtually all other
  Make replacements fail.  Most Make replacement force the user to write
  loops or similar constructs. 
* Generality:  Don't focus on a particular use case such as compilation,
  but be a generic build tool.  There are no built-in rules for
  compilation or other specific applications.  Instead, allow use
  case-specific rules to be written in the Stu language itself.  Most
  Make replacement tools instead focus on one specific use-case (almost
  always compilation), making them unsuitable for general use. 
* Files are the central datatype.  Everything is a file.  You can think
  of Stu as "a declarative programming language in which all variables
  are files."  For instance, Stu has no variables like Make; instead,
  files are used.  Other Make replacements are even worse than Make in
  this regard, and allow any variable in whatever programming language
  they are using.  Stu is based on the Unix principle that any
  persistent object should have a name in the file system -- "everything
  is a file."   
* Scalability:  Assume that projects are so large that you can't just
  clean and rebuild everything if there are build inconsistencies.
  Files are sacred; never make the user delete files in order to rebuild
  things.   
* Simplicity:  Do one thing well.  We don't include features such as file
  compression that can be achieved by other tools from within shell
  commands.  List of files and dependencies are themselves targets that
  are built using shell commands, and therefore any external software
  can be used to define them, without any special support needed from
  Stu.  Too many Make replacements try to "avoid the shell" and include
  every transformation possible into the tool, effectively amassing
  dozens of unnecessary dependencies, and creating an ad-hoc language
  much less well-defined, and let alone portable, than the shell.
* Debuggability:  Like programs written in any programming language, Stu
  scripts will contain errors.  Stu makes it easy to detect and correct
  errors by having much better error messages than Make.  This is
  achieved by (1) having a proper syntax based on tokenization (rather
  than Make's text replacement rules), and (2) having "compiler-grade"
  error messages, showing not only what went wrong, but how Stu got
  there.  Anyone who has ever wondered why a certain Make rule was
  executed (or not) will know the value of this. 
* Portability:  Embrace POSIX as an underlying standard. Use the shell
  as the underlying command interpreter. Don't try to create a
  purportedly portable layer on top of it, as POSIX _already is_ a
  portability layer.  Also, don't try to create a new portable language
  for executing commands, as /bin/sh _already is_ one.  Furthermore,
  don't use fancy libraries or hip programming languages.  Stu is
  written in plain C++11 with only standard libraries.  Many other Make
  replacements are based on specific programming languages as their
  "base standard", effectively limiting their use to that language, and
  thus preventing projects to use multiple programming languages.
  Others even do worse and create their own mini-language, invariably
  less portable and more buggy than the shell. 
* Reliability:  Stu has extensive unit test coverage, with more than 1,000
  tests.  All published versions pass 100% of these tests.  All language
  features and error paths are unit tested.   
* Stability:  We follow Semantic Versioning (semver.org) in order to
  provide syntax and semantics that are stable over time.  Stu scripts
  written now will still work in the future.    
* Familiarity:  Stu follows the conventions of Make and of the shell as
  much as possible, to make it easier to make the switch from Make to
  Stu.  For instance, the options -j and -k work like in Make.  Also,
  Stu source can be edited with syntax highlighting for the shell, as
  the syntaxes are very similar.  

--------------------
 Comparison to Make
--------------------

In addition to the properties described above, advantages of Stu over
Make are: 

* Error messages are much better (Make has the dreaded "missing
  separator"); Stu gives full traces like a good compiler.  If you get
  an error, you know which part of the Stu script to fix.  
* Stu has a proper tokenization pass, instead of Make's variable
  substitution syntax.  This makes the whole language much more
  predictable. 
* Variables are not used; instead Stu encourages to put everything in
  files.  This makes builds much faster: In a typical Makefile, a lot of
  program logic must be implemented used Make functions (because of a
  lack of dynamic dependencies), making a large piece of code being
  executed on each Make invocation, even if the variables have not
  changed.  
* Stu catches typical Makefile errors such as dependencies that where
  not built.  Make cannot do this because the namespace for files is
  intermixed with namespace for phony targets.  In Stu, both namespaces
  are separate (phony targets are called "transient targets" in Stu),
  and thus Stu can perform all checks properly. 
* Stu has better support for interrupting large builds.  Make will often
  hang or leave processes running. 
* Stu avoids the "inner platform" antipattern present in Make, in which
  a lot of shell functionality is duplicated in Make functions.  For
  instance, why are there text filtering functions in Make when the
  shell already has grep and other tools?  That's because in Make, you
  cannot use shell commands to define dynamic dependencies, so Make
  evolved to have its own mini text filtering language.  Instead, Stu
  allows and encourages all program logic to be implemented in ordinary
  rules, i.e. using a proper shell.  
* Stu supports additional types of dependencies which are essential in
  large, complex projects, such as persistent dependencies with the
  prefix -p (whose timestamps are always ignored), optional dependencies
  with -o (instead of writing custom code that check whether a file is
  present and making it impossible to let that file have dependencies of
  its own), and trivial dependencies with -t (used e.g. for generating
  compile-time options, or even a custom compiler).  These can only be
  emulated partially with Make by using unwieldy constructs.

---------
 Use Stu
---------

To use Stu, replace your 'Makefile' with a 'main.stu' file, and instead
of calling 'make', call 'stu'. 

The see an example of Stu used in a large data mining project, see the
file 'main.stu' in the KONECT-Analysis project:

 About 
-------

Stu was originally written to accommodate the KONECT project (Koblenz
Network Collection -- http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/).  It is thus mainly
used for large data mining projects, where it manages everything from
acquiring data from the web, preprocessing data in various ways, to
performing data mining experiments, to generating plots and compiling
the resulting Latex papers.  It is also used for compiling C/C++ code,
for generating tarballs, for generating websites, and by students
associated with Jérôme Kunegis.

The name "Stu" follows the precedents of Make replacements such as Cook,
Bake, and Brew in referring to kitchen-related verbs, and also honors
the author of the original Unix Make, Stuart Feldman.

Stu was initiated by Jérôme Kunegis at the University of Koblenz-Landau
(Germany), and is currently maintained at the University of Namur
(Belgium), with help from other contributors; see the file AUTHORS.
