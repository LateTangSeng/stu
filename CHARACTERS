This file catalogues the usage of individual characters in Stu files.
Since Stu is used to specify filenames, many characters that are used as
operators in programming languages are allowed in filenames, such as
'+', '-', etc.  Other characters are used as operators.  All operators
in Stu consist of a single character.  

== Allowed in unquoted names == 

[a-z] [A-Z] [0-9] 
_ ^ ` + - . ~ / 
[all non-ASCII characters]

== Recognized as whitespace == 

everything for which isspace() returns true in the C locale, i.e., only
ASCII spaces and tabs, etc. (" \f\n\r\t\v")

== Not allowed outside quotes == 

ASCII control characters (except those that are space)  

== Characters introducing longer tokens == 

# 	Comment (until the end of the line) 
%	Statements (followed by the statement name, and optionally followed
	by arguments depending on the statement); comparable to preprocessor
	directives 
" '	Quotes 
{}	Command, content
$	Parameter, variable dependencies 

== Operators == 

These characters are single-character tokens. 

:	Rule definition
;	End of rule
@	Phony target
( )	List 
[ ]	Dynamic list
>	Output redirection
<	Input redirection 
!	Existence-only dependency
?	Optional dependency 
&	Trivial dependency
=	Assignment (future: copy, named variable)

== As-yet unused operators ==

*	String concatenation 
,	modifiers (e.g., ',0' for \0-separated input files). 
\	interpreter for non-shell rules:  \octave { }
|	(no proposed use)
