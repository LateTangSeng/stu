To install Stu, do this:

* run ./configure
* run make
* run make install

REQUIREMENTS

* Stu assumes ASCII
* POSIX
* Stu calls /bin/sh and /bin/cp at runtime.
* ANSI color code-compatible terminal

COMPILATION OPTIONS

* USE_MTIM (default: enabled if CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE is present):  Use
  struct timespec instead of time_t for timekeeping.  struct timespec
  supports nanosecond timestamps in principle. In practice, most systems
  are likely to support only a precision on the order of a millisecond.
  Works only on Linux, as it uses CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE.  See the
  comments in timestamp.hh.  

UNIT TESTS

* (optional) Execute all unit tests using 'make -f Makefile.devel'.  If
  an error is reported, please report it to the developers.  It takes
  about five minutes (running the tests, not reporting to the
  developers).
