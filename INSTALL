There is no installation command or Make target for installation.  To
install Stu, do the following:  

* Compile Stu using 'make'.  This will build the executable
  'stu.ndebug'. 

* (optional) Execute all unit tests using 'make -f Makefile.test'.  If
  an error is reported, report it to the developers.  It takes about ten
  minutes.  

* Copy the executable 'stu.ndebug' to a bin/ directory under the name
  'stu', e.g. /usr/bin/ or ~/bin/.  You can of course also just execute
  it right from where it is.  The executable has no runtime
  dependencies, so it does not matter where it is residing while it is
  being executed, and also its filename does not matter.   

* Copy the man page 'stu.1' to a man page directory,
  e.g. /usr/share/man/man1/ or ~/man/man1/.  (In that second example,
  you will have to put $HOME/man into your $MANPATH additionally.)

REQUIREMENTS

* The Makefile uses 'c++' as the C++ compiler, with the option
  '-std=c++11'.  To use something else, edit the Makefile. 

UNIT TESTS

If you want to run the unit tests, do 'make -f Makefile.test'.  If takes
about 10 minutes. 

* The unit tests assume that the filesystem supports UTF-8 filenames.
  Stu will work without such a filesystem, but you can't run the unit
  tests unless you remove the one offending test (test/unicode/).  
* The unit tests need a GNU version of sed(1); they use the -r option.  
* If you run the tests and they fail, please report that to Jérôme
  Kunegis <kunegis@gmail.com>.
