To install Stu, do this:

* run ./configure
* run make
* run make install

REQUIREMENTS

* Stu assumes ASCII
* POSIX
* Stu calls /bin/sh and /bin/cp at runtime.

COMPILATION OPTIONS

* USE_MTIM (default: unset):  Use struct timespec instead of time_t for
  timekeeping.  struct timespec supports nanosecond timestamps in
  principle. In practice, most systems are likely to support only a
  precision on the order of a millisecond.  Works only on Linux, as it
  uses CLOCK_REALIME_COARSE.  See the comments in timestamp.hh. 

UNIT TESTS

* (optional) Execute all unit tests using 'make -f Makefile.devel'.  If
  an error is reported, please report it to the developers.  It takes
  about five minutes (running the tests, not reorting to the
  developers).
