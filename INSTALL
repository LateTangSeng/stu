There is no installation command or Make target for installation.  To
install Stu, do the following:  

* Compile Stu using 'make'.  This will build the executable 'stu'. 

* (optional) Execute all unit tests using 'make -f Makefile.test'.  If
  an error is reported, please report it to the developers.  It takes
  about five minutes (running the tests, not reorting to the
  developers).   

* Copy the executable 'stu' to a bin/ directory, e.g. to /usr/bin/ or to 
  ~/bin/.  You can of course also just execute it right from where it
  is.  The executable has no runtime dependencies, so it does not matter
  where it is residing while it is being executed, and also its filename
  does not matter.    

* Copy the man page 'stu.1' to a man page directory,
  e.g. /usr/share/man/man1/ or ~/man/man1/.  (In that second example,
  you will have to put $HOME/man into your $MANPATH additionally.)  

REQUIREMENTS

* A C++11 compiler.  The Makefile uses 'c++' as the C++ compiler, with
  the option '-std=c++11'.  To use something else, edit the Makefile.   
* Stu assumes ASCII. 
* POSIX.
* Stu calls /bin/sh and /bin/cp at runtime.
