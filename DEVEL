Some information for developing Stu.

TODO.stu lists the next features to be implemented. 

==== SETUP ====

Stu uses the GNU Auto* tools.  For development, use "make -f Makefile.devel". 

Before committing changes:
* Increment the version number in VERSION
* Run make -f Makefile.devel successfully

Version logic:
* Increment the patch version number for any changes
* Increment the minor version number when backward-compatible new syntax
  is introduced   
* Increment the major version number when backward-incompatible new
  syntax is introduced 

==== HINTS ====

* Follow ./CODING
* Write unit tests for all features, including failure modes; see sh/mktest

==== UNIT TESTS ====

Unit testing is described in sh/mktest. 

To run the unit tests, do 'make -f Makefile.devel'.  It takes about five
minutes in all.   

The unit tests have additional requirements on the system: 

* The unit tests assume that the file system supports UTF-8 filenames.
  Stu will work without such a file system, but you can't run the unit
  tests unless you remove the one offending test (test/unicode/).  
* The unit tests use 'test -a', which is marked as obsolete in POSIX. 

If you run the tests and they fail, report that to Jérôme Kunegis <kunegis@gmail.com>.
