Some hints for developing Stu:

* TODO.stu lists the next features to be implemented 
* Increment the patch version number for any changes
* Increment the minor version number when backward-compatible new syntax
  is introduced   
* Increment the major version number when backward-incompatible new
  syntax is introduced 
* The unit tests must pass
* Following CODING
* Write unit tests for all features, including failure modes 
* When writing shell scripts, make sure to follow POSIX.  This includes: 
** 'sed' has *only* basic regular expressions.  In particular, no '|'. 
** Shell scripts don't have a filename suffix.  Use '#! /bin/sh'. 

UNIT TESTS

To run the unit tests, do 'make -f Makefile.test'.  It takes about 10
minutes.  

The unit tests have additional requirements: 

* The unit tests assume that the file system supports UTF-8 filenames.
  Stu will work without such a file system, but you can't run the unit
  tests unless you remove the one offending test (test/unicode/).  
* The unit tests use 'test -a', which is marked as obsolete in POSIX. 

If you run the tests and they fail, please report that to Jérôme
Kunegis <kunegis@gmail.com>.
