This is information for developing Stu.

'TODO.stu' lists the next features to be implemented. 

'CODING' gives the coding standards used in Stu. 

==== SETUP ====

Stu uses the GNU Auto* tools.  For development, use "make -f
Makefile.devel".  Yes, the GNU Auto* tools lose on many grounds, and it
would be *much* nicer to use Stu instead, but obviously Stu should be
compilable without Stu. 

Before pushing changes to Github:
* Increment the version number in VERSION
* Run make -f Makefile.devel successfully

Version logic (see 'NEWS' for an explanation of version numbers): 
* Increment the patch version number for any changes
* Increment the minor version number when backward-compatible new syntax
  is introduced   
* Increment the major version number when backward-incompatible new
  syntax is introduced 

==== UNIT TESTS ====

Unit testing is described in 'sh/mktest'. 

To run the unit tests, do 'make -f Makefile.devel'.  It takes about five
minutes in all.   

The unit tests have additional requirements on the system: 

* The unit tests assume that the file system supports UTF-8 filenames.
  Stu will work without such a file system, but you can't run the unit
  tests unless you remove the one offending test (test/unicode/).  
* You need to install "expect", "autoconf". 

If you run the tests and they fail, report that to Jérôme Kunegis
<kunegis@gmail.com>.
