/* Code for managing errors in Stu.  Errors codes in Stu are represented
 * by integers between 0 and 4, as defined in the ERROR_* constants
 * below.  Zero represents no error.  These codes are used for both
 * Stu's exit code, as well as internally in variables named "error". 
 */ 

/* Format of error output:  There are two types of error output lines:
 * error messages and traces.  Error messages are of the form 
 *
 *         $0: *** $MESSAGE
 * 
 * and traces are of the form 
 *
 *         $FILENAME:$LINE:$COLUMN:$MESSAGE
 *
 * Traces are used when it is possible to refer to a specific location
 * in the input files (or command line, etc.).  Errors are avoided when
 * possible: all errors should be traced back to a place in the source
 * if possible.
 */

/* Wording of messages:  Error messages begin with uppercase letters;
 * trace messages with lowercase letters.  Filenames and operator names
 * are quoted in messages using single quotes.  Messages for both types of
 * error output lines are not terminated by periods.  
 *
 * Use "expected TOKEN" instead of "missing TOKEN".  (Because some
 * tokens in the given list may be optional, making the "missing"
 * phrasing confusing, as it would imply that the token is mandatory.)
 * Include articles after "expected" to avoid interpreting "expected" as
 * an adjective.  Don't mention the invalid token, i.e., don't use
 * phrases such as "invalid token". 
 * 
 * Use "must not" instead of "cannot" in error messages, e.g., "filename
 * must not be empty".  But remember that in general it is better to
 * state what what expected in the syntax than to say that what was
 * encountered cannot be used.  For instance, say "expected a filename"
 * instead of "filename must not be empty".

/* Build errors (code 1) are the most common errors encountered by Stu:
 * commands that fail, files that cannot be accessed, etc.  Stu will
 * continue execution after a build error when the -k option is used.
 *
 * Logical errors (code 2) are mostly syntax errors in the source code,
 * but also things like cycles in the dependency graph.  Logical errors
 * indicate errors within the Stu files.  Logical errors may or may not
 * make Stu abort execution.
 * 
 * System errors (code 4) are errors that lead Stu to abort immediately,
 * even when the -k option is used.  
 *
 * The "not up to date" code (5) is only used as an exit code with in
 * question mode (option -q). 
 * 
 * Build and logical errors can be combined to give error code 3.
 * System errors are never combined with other errors as they make Stu
 * abort immediately.
