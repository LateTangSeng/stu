# Test all 'switch' cases, like this:

A:  -X <CCC>  -Y <CCC>  { ... }

# where:
#   -X and -Y are all possible combinations of transitive flags
#   <CCC> is one of:
#      (1) Direct dependency C
#      (2) Transient to C
#      (3) Dynamic dependency that contains C
#      (4) Concatenation that results in C
