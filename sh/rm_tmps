# Remove temporary files created by tests.  The tests only create
# temporary files of these patterns.  Executed within each test
# directory.  Any of such named files may be directories. 
#
# None of the patterns matches any file that we would create within the
# main stu/ directory, so wwe can safely call this to remove junk files
# created while debugging.  In particular, as two-letter files are good
# for testing, except 'sh'.
