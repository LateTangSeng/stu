# TODO 
#
# * Add a "part" bit to Type. 
#
# *  Introduce a new type of Execution which is a "Concatenate Child
# Execution", and keeps track of the list of eventual single dynamic
# dependencies of an individual (arbitralily dynamically nested)
# dependency.  These Execution types are cached. 

# Concatenation
# Copy of concatenation-001.
