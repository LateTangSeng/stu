#==== Backward-incompatible features (in the switch to version 2) ====

#
# Make 'single quotes' and "double quotes" behave like in the shell,
# i.e., with respect to what needs to be quoted inside them. 
#

# * Don't allow backslash-escaped sequences inside single quotes
# * Allow double quotes, backslashes and other literal characters inside single quotes
# * Allow single quote inside double quotes
# * Allow parameters inside double quotes

# Current rules:
#   ":  \" \' \\ \*     ':  \" \' \\ \*
# New rules:
#   ":  \"    \\ \* $   ':  

'abc"def';         # contains a double quote
"Image $name.png"; # contains a parameter
"aaa'bbb";         # contains a single quote
'aaa\bbb';         # contains a backslash
'aaa$bbb';         # contains a dollar sign

#
# Don't allow filenames that start with '+' or '-', but allow these in
# the middle or at the end of filenames.  
#
# Also those beginning with '~'. 
#

#
# Keep track of spacing between tokens, and disallow no space in
# situations that will later be used for string concatenation. 
#

#
# Use '-' options for the three flags !, ?, and &.   
#

A:  
	-e X # timestamp-ignoring
	-o X # optional
        -t X # trivial
{ ... }

# Have options to switch all of these in subsequent targets, or to
# switch it off. 

# Maybe, invert the meaning of '-' and '+' to have '+' mean "switch
# on". 

# Have corresponding command-line options. 

#
# Deprecate !, ?, and &, and define as reserved for future extension. 
#

#==== Features of Stu 2:  Mandatory ====

#
# Flag -n for newline-separate filename lists
#

A: [ -n B ] { while read -r file ; do ... "$file" ... ; done }
>B { find ... }

#
# Have a way for dynamic dependencies to contain \0-separated filenames,
# to avoid quoting.  Not clear that this is the best syntax for it.
#

A: [ -0 <B ] { xargs -0 ... }

#
# Make 
#
#    A = ? B ;
#
# work:
#   * Fail when both A and B are not present
#   * Succeed when A is present and B is not
#

#
# Recursive timestamp-ignoring dependency:  If the file exists, never
# rebuild it, regardless whether its dependencies have to be rebuilt.
# Actual timestamp-ignoring dependencies do not work like this, as they only
# ignore the targets timestamp, but don't change anything about its
# dependencies.  
#

#
# String multiplication.  String multiplication is to work both with the
# binary operator '*' as well with juxtaposition.  Juxtaposition is
# backward incompatible, as in Version 1 strings like "A[B]" where
# interpreted as two dependencies, and with it they will be interpreted
# as one. 
#

A:  B * C;    	        # Binary multiplication operator
A:  B * (C D); 	        # Parentheses
A:  B[C];      	        # Juxtaposition
A:  [B]C;      	        # OK
A:  B(C D);    	        # OK
A:  B(C D)E;   	        # OK
A:  B[C]D;     	        # OK
A:  [B] * [C]; 	        # OK
A:  (A B) * (C D); 	# OK
A:  [B][C];             # OK
A:  (A B)(C D);         # OK
A:  (!B) * (C);    	# OK
A:  (?B) * (C);    	# OK
A:  (B) * (!C);    	# error
A:  (B) * (?C);    	# error
A:  (?B) * (!C);   	# error
A:  (<B) * (C);    	# OK
A:  (B) * (<C);    	# error

A:  B * $[C];    	# error
A:  <B * C;      	# OK (or maybe:  ambiguous)
A:  B * <C;      	# error
A:  <B[C];		# OK iff C contains exactly one dependency (or an error)
@A: @B[C];       	# OK
A:  B@C;		# error
A.$X.$Y:  $X * $Y       # OK (can be contiguous)

#==== Features of Stu 2:  Other features ====

#
# Option -N:  dry run, but build dynamic dependencies.  Not clearcut
# because dynamic dependencies can also take long to build. 
#

#
# Search within predefined paths for %include ($STU_PATH or $STUPATH;
# the -I option)
#

% include c++.stu
 
#
# Option -B:  Remake all targets regardless of dates
#

#
# Optimization:  when parsing rules, only save the "body" part of the
# rule (everything except the target) as an unparsed string.  Parse it
# properly only when needed. 
#

#
# Line number syntax:  A preprocessor-like construct that gives a new
# filename and line number, such that error messages from Stu can point
# to the original file, not the generated file.  Analogous to the
# preprocessors #line directive.  Useful in dynamic dependencies. 
#

%line ...

#
# Flag rules
#

# Allow flags on the target filenames.  Example with '-o':

# If $NAME.svg is present, use it to build $NAME.pdf.  If $NAME.svg is
# not present, allow $NAME.pdf to be present without any dependencies.
# The big question is how can the rule distinguish when the rule is
# activated.  When all dependencies exist?  When all dependencies
# *could* be built? 
-o $NAME.pdf:  $NAME.svg
{
	inkscape ...
}

#
# Variables of the flags that apply to all children, not just immediate
# ones.  
#

$ stu '-E A'

# will completely ignore timestamps in all files.  

# This will also cover cases that are implemented as options at the
# moment, e.g. -g: 

$ stu '\?A'

# is equivalent to

$ stu -g A

# In this example, '\' is the negation operator. 

#
# Disable flags with '+' options
#

A: -o @x;
@x: +o B;

# Equivalent to
A: B;

#
# Dynamic dependencies are "timestamp-ignoring" by default.  Make it
# possible to switch this off using '+e'.  This is useful when the
# dynamic dependency file itself is used by the target, e.g. when
# creating a tarball. 
#

A.tar: [ +e FILES ] { tar cfvv A.tar $(cat FILES) }

# 
# An option (-u) to consider all targets up to date.  I.e., execute only the
# minimum to get the given files built. 
#

#
# When accessing directories, maybe use not mtime, but something else?
#
# * when stat() succeeds and the file is a directory, use creation time
#   instead of modification time
# * this will make it impossible to build directories that are more than
#   just { mkdir -p }
#

#
# Removeable files:  when a file carries the removeable flag, it does
# not need to be present.  
#

A: -R B;  B: C;  A: D;

# * When A is old, B does not exist, and C is new:  rebuild B and A.
# * When A is new, B does not exist, and C is old:  don't rebuild A.
# * When A is new, B does not exist, C is old, and D is very new:  rebuild
#   B and A.
