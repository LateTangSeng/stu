From each major version to the next, changes in Stu are
backward-incompatible.  This file lists required changes in Stu files
needed to migrate to a new major version. 

See the file 'NEWS' for more information about Stu versioning. 

== Version 1 -> Version 2 ==

(1) Quotes were changed to work like in the shell.  This makes it easier
for shell programmers, and also makes it easier for people using shell
syntax highlighted on Stu sources.

Single quotes cannot contain escape sequences anymore.  Single quotes
now work like single quotes in the shell:  they can contain any
unescaped character, except single quotes.  Also, unescaped newlines are
now allowed in single quotes. 

Double quotes are now the only quotes that allow backslash escape
sequences.  They now also allow unescaped single quotes, and newline
characters.  Also, they may now contain parameters starting with the
dollar character, and therefore they now also support the \$ escape
sequence. 

Code containing quoted strings may now have to be changed.  Dynamic
dependencies automatically generating quoted strings may also have to be
changed.  (Although in Stu 2, it is recommended to use newline- or
NUL-delimited dynamic dependencies instead.)

== Version 0 -> Version 1 ==

(1) Timestamp-ignoring dependencies are noted by '!' instead of '*'.  The
goal of this change is to allow '*' to be used to target list
multiplication later on, and to make the syntax of timestamp-ignoring
dependencies be analogous to the notation for optional dependencies
which will be noted with '?'. 

Migration:  Change all '*'s to '!'s.

Example:  Change

A: *B {...}

to

A: !B {...}

(2) Variables no longer exist.  The reason of this change is that
variables were almost never used, and their functionality could be
easily created by using files.  Since the variable syntax was different
and unflexible, actual Stu scripts ended up using files anyway, so it
was decided to free the '$' symbol for parameters, which is the reason
for the chain shift of symbols following this one. 

Migration:  Instead, declare files that contain the required content,
and include them using $[...] syntax.    

Example:  Change

$CFLAGS : -g -Wall ;
a:  a.c $CFLAGS { gcc ... $CFLAGS ... }

to

CFLAGS { echo -g -Wall >CFLAGS }
a:  a.c $[CFLAGS] { gcc ... $CFLAGS ... }

(3) Parameters are given in dollar syntax instead of bracket syntax, and
parameter values are now passed as variables to the command shell
instead of using text substitution.  This is the logical thing to do as
now the variables are given to the shell as parameters instead of text
substitution, which avoids quoting problems.  Also, the dollar syntax is
nearer to that of the shell itself, making Stu easier to learn and Stu
files are now easier to edit using shell syntax highlighting.  Also, in
most cases the syntax is shorter now, both because one can replace
'[NAME]' by '$NAME', and because unnecessary cases of 'NAME=[NAME]' in
the command can be omitted. 

Migration:  Change [FILENAME] to $FILENAME everywhere.  Note that with
dollar syntax, only alphanumeric characters and '_' are allowed; others
will have to be renamed.  Note that in shell syntax, the safe thing to
do is to enclose the passed parameters in double quotes, while the
safest thing to do in Version 0 was to use single quotes (but that
didn't work when the parameter values contained single quotes.)  In many
cases, expressions such as NAME='[NAME]' can simply be omitted.
Analogously, dynamic variables are now denoted by $[VARIABLE] instead
of $<VARIABLE>. 

Example:  Change

[NAME].data: $<FLAGS> generate {
	NAME='[NAME]' ./generate
}
[NAME].eps:  [NAME].data mkplot {
	./mkplot --name '[NAME]'
}

to

$NAME.data: $[FLAGS] generate {
	./generate
}
$NAME.eps:  $NAME.data mkplot {
	./mkplot --name "$NAME"
}

(4) Dynamic dependencies are now denoted with brackets instead of
braces.  The brackets syntax is similar to Cook's syntax for file
inclusion, and the pair '[]' is actually a pair of brackets in Unicode,
as opposed to '<>' which are the greater-than and less-than operators.
Also, the operators '<' and '>' are now free and will be used for file
redirection in the future.  

Migration:  Change <FILENAME> to [FILENAME].
