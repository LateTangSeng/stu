Job - A job is a child process started by Stu to build one or more files
        or transient targets.  Jobs are run in the background by
        default, but the -i option

Transient - One of the two basic datatypes ("targets") of Stu.  They are
	noted with the '@' symbol, e.g., '@all'.  A transient can be
	built like a file, but will not result in a built file.  A
	transient can also be used only for its dependency.
