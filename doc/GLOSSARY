// TODO This list was just started and is incomplete. 

Command - A command that is run for a target.  Enclosed by braces ({}) in
	Stu source, and executed with the shell. 

Flag - A flag is a syntax and semantic element of Stu scripts.  They
	start with a dash.  An example is '-p' for persistent
	dependencies. 

Job - A job is a child process started by Stu to build one or more files
        or transient targets.  Jobs are run in the background by
        default, but the -i option

Option - An option is passed on the Stu command line and starts with a
	dash.  Some have arguments. 

Parameter - A parameter in the name of a file or a transient; introduced
	by the dollar sign ($).  In command, the corresponding
	environment variable is set. 

Transient - One of the two basic datatypes ("targets") of Stu.  They are
	noted with the '@' symbol, e.g., '@all'.  A transient can be
	built like a file, but will not result in a built file.  A
	transient can also be used only for its dependency.
