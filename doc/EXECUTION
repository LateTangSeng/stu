### Not dynamic, not concatenated, file  (Single_Execution) 
* (1): [ ] Build own dependencies 
* (a):     Execute command, if any
* Own result contains only the own filename 

### Not dynamic, not concatenated, transient  (Single_Execution) 
* (1): [ ] Build own dependencies
* (a):     Execute command, if any
* Own result is concatenation of the results of own dependencies

### Not dynamic, concatenated  (Concatenated_Execution) 
* (1): [*] Each part
* (2): [=] From concatenation of the results given by (1)
* Own result comes from (1) 

### Dynamic, not concatenated, file  (Dynamic_Execution)
* (1): [*] Own dependency with the single outer dynamic level removed
* (2): [=] Result of (1) with the own outer dynamic level added in, omitted if single
* Own result comes from (2)
