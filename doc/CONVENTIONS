Here are some conventions to use when writing Stu scripts.  These are
used by the authors, but they are not enforced by Stu, and you may have
very good reasons to not do things this way.  By the way, these are very
good tips also if you don't use Stu.

* Use lowercase for parameter names.  It's less likely to clash with
  existing environment variables, and makes code read more like a
  "normal programming language". 
* Directory names end in '/' when used as Stu target/dependency names.
  Ending directory filenames in '/' is always a good idea, except in
  path lists delimited by ':', where ending '/' should be omitted. 
* If there is a setting that will be changed occasionally by hand (such
  as enabling/disabling assertions), it may be easier to compile two
  versions of the programs, with the value of that setting encoded in
  the filename. 
* Separate names of parameters in filenames by dots ('.'), and avoid
  dots within individual parameter values.  That will avoid certain
  filename matching errors. 
* Avoid "cd".  In a single project that uses Stu, have a base directory
  in which 'main.stu' is located, and do everything from there.  Inside
  each program that is run, assume the currently directory is that base
  directory. 
* Prefer symlinks over configuration files.  Often, a project needs to
  access files outside its own directory.  To do this, prefer to have a
  symlink to the external directory and access the files through that,
  rather than having the path stored in a configuration file or
  environment variable. 
* Don't use system-wide configurations.  Some systems (e.g. databases)
  rely on configuration files that are outside the current directory,
  for instance by placing their configuration in /etc/.  Avoid this as
  much as possible.  Configuration files should be part of the project
  like any other file, and should be put where other files are.  (Of
  course, for things like user options, system- and user-wide
  configuration files are 100% OK.)
* Don't use environment variables for configuration, as Stu will not
  notice when they change.  Instead, put their content in a single file,
  and use Stu's $[FILENAME] syntax to access it.
