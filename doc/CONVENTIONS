Here are some conventions for using Stu.  These are used by the authors,
but they are not enforced by Stu.

* Directory names end in '/'
* If there is a setting that will be changed occasionally by hand (such
  as enabling/disabling assertions), it may be easier to compile two
  versions of the programs, with the value of that setting encoded in
  the filename. 
* Separate names of parameters in filenames by dots ('.')
